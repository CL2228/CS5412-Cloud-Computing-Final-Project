# **Azure function Module**
> This module is the core of this CS5412 final project. It contains serverless functions that suppor the central functionality of the project.

## **Run this module**
> There is no need for you to configure this module to run on your local computer or on Azure. All serverless functions are already running on Azure. The aim of this page is to provide instructions on how to use APIs I implemented.
